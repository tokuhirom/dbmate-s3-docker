# config file for the tagpr in git config format
# The tagpr generates the initial configuration, which you can rewrite to suit your environment.
# CONFIGURATIONS:
#   tagpr.releaseBranch
#       Generally, it is "main." It is the branch for releases. The tagpr tracks this branch,
#       creates or updates a pull request as a release candidate, or tags when they are merged.
#
#   tagpr.versionFile
#       Versioning file containing the semantic version needed to be updated at release.
#       It will be synchronized with the "git tag".
#       Often this is a meta file such as gemspec, setup.cfg, package.json, etc.
#       Sometimes the source code file, such as version.go or Bar.pm, is used.
#       If you do not want to use versioning files but only git tags, specify the "-" string here.
#       You can specify multiple version files by comma separated strings.
#
#   tagpr.vPrefix
#       Flag whether or not v-prefix is needed for git tags. (e.g. "v1.2.3" if true)
#       This is only a tagging convention, not how it is described in the version file.
#
#   tagpr.changelog (Optional)
#       Flag whether or not changelog is added to the release pull request body.
#       If true, the release pull request will include changelog.
#       Default is true.
#
#   tagpr.command (Optional)
#       Command to be executed after tagging. Rendered in a Go template format.
#       Env `TAGPR_VERSION` is always available and holds the release version.
#
#   tagpr.template (Optional)
#       Pull request template in go template format
#
#   tagpr.release (Optional)
#       GitHub Release creation behavior after tagging. Possible values are:
#         - true: Create a GitHub Release (default)
#         - false: Do not create a GitHub Release
#         - draft: Create a GitHub Release as a draft
#
#   tagpr.majorLabels (Optional)
#       Label to indicate that the next version should be a major version up.
#       Default is [major].
#
#   tagpr.minorLabels (Optional)
#       Label to indicate that the next version should be a minor version up.
#       Default is [minor].
#
#   tagpr.rcBranchPrefix (Optional)
#       Prefix for release candidate branch. Default is "rc-".
